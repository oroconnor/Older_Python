# Older_Python
assorted Python scripts from early learning

Python was my first programming language. This repository has a bunch of scripts from my early journey of programming, working through expercises in books and courses.
Since then, my computer science coursework has largely been in Java, and I do most of my professional work in R. So you're not going to find any of my best 
programming work in this repository.
